    <h2>nominal</h2>
    
    
    <p>
	<tt>nominal</tt> provides a library to check Java identifier names for 
	compliance with naming conventions. <tt>nominal</tt> provides three 
	sets of naming conventions and a declarative language for specifying 
	naming conventions.
    </p>
  
  
   <h3>Usage</h3>
   <p>The class {@code Nominal} provides four static methods that create instances 
       using either conventions definitions packaged with the library, or 
       a file written in nominal's language that specifies naming conventions.
       (Information about the language for specifying conventions is in the 
       file docs/nominal-language in the distributed archive.)
       The class {@code Nominal} has a method test() used to evaluate the 
       compliance of instances of {@code IdentifierName} with the specified 
       set of conventions. 
   </p>
   <p>
       Instances of {@code IdentifierName} are created by the caller and require 
       classes in <tt>idtk-j</tt> as well as {@code TokenisedName} and {@code TaggedToken}. 
       
   </p>
   
  
  <h3>Copyright and License</h3>
  <p>nominal is Copyright &copy; 2013-2015 The Open University and 
      Copyright &copy; 2017 Simon Butler, and is open 
  source software licensed under version 2.0 of the Apache License.

  <h3>Requirements</h3>
  <p>nominal requires Java v8 to run.</p>
  
 <h3>Building</h3>
 <p><tt>nominal</tt> can be built using the Gradle build tool. All dependencies 
 are available from the Maven central repository or the jCenter repository. 
 A POM is also provided so Maven should be able to build nominal. </p>
 
 <h3>Dependencies</h3>
 <p>Dependencies are  specified in the Gradle build script and are downloaded 
     from Maven central during the build process. If building nominal 
     without Gradle the following dependencies are required:</p>
 <ol>
  <li>SLF4J - nominal uses SLF4J for logging. Incorporating SLF4J in 
    (exisitng) code is straightforward. A copy of slf4j-api.x.x.x.jar 
    must be on the classpath when compiling and running nominal. 
    Another slf4j jar will also be required to support logging 
    -- see <a href="http://slf4j.org/">http://slf4j.org/</a> for more information
    nominal was coded against slf4j v1.7.25, so v1.7.25 or greater
    should work</li>
 <li>mdsc - nominal uses mdsc v0.1.1 which is available at 
  <a href="https://github.com/sjbutler/mdsc/">https://github.com/sjbutler/mdsc/</a></li>
 <li>idtk-j - nominal uses classes from idtk-j v0.5.0 which is available at 
  <a href="https://github.com/sjbutler/idtk-j/">https://github.com/sjbutler/idtk-j/</a></li>
 <li>ANTLR - ANTLR 4 is required to run nominal and to compile any
   changes to the grammar. antlr-x.x-complete.jar must be on 
   the classpath. nominal was coded against ANTLR v4.7
   See <a href="http://www.antlr.org/">http://www.antlr.org/</a>
   (ANTLRWorks 2 is a useful tool for working with ANTLR grammars)</li>
 </ol>
 
 
 <h3>Caveat</h3>
 <p>nominal is research software. As such it is subject to change and 
 no guarantees can be made about the stability of any API. There is 
 also no guarantee that nominal will be maintained. </p>
