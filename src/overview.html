    <h2>nominal</h2>
    
    
  <p>nominal provides a library to check Java identifier names for compliance  
  with naming conventions. nominal provides three sets of naming conventions 
  and a declarative language for specifying naming conventions.</p>
  
  
   <h3>Usage</h3>
   <p>The class {@code Nominal} provides four static methods that create instances 
       using either conventions definitions packaged with the library, or 
       a file written in nominal's language that specifies naming conventions.
       (Information about the language for specifying conventions is in the 
       file docs/nominal-language in the distributed archive.)
       The class {@code Nominal} has a method test() used to test instances of 
       {@code IdentifierName}. 
   </p>
   <p>
       Instances of {@code IdentifierName} are created by the caller and requires 
       classes in idtk-j as well as {@code TokenisedName} and {@code TaggedToken}.
   </p>
   
  
  <h3>Copyright and License</h3>
  <p>nominal is Copyright &copy; 2013-2015 The Open University and is open 
  source software licensed under version 2.0 of the Apache License. 
  A copy of the licence can be found in the file LICENCE and the

  <h3>Requirements</h3>
  <p>nominal requires Java v8 to run. It is possible to revise nominal 
  to run using Java 7, but a lot of work would be entailed.</p>
  
 <h3>Dependencies</h3>
 <p>nominal has the following dependencies:</p>
 <ol>
  <li>SLF4J - nominal uses SLF4J for logging. Incorporating SLF4J in 
    (exisitng) code is straightforward. A copy of slf4j-api.x.x.x.jar 
    must be on the classpath when compiling and running nominal. 
    Another slf4j jar will also be required to support logging 
    -- see <a href="http://slf4j.org/">http://slf4j.org/</a> for more information
    nominal was coded against slf4j v1.7.7, so v1.7.7 or greater
    should work</li>
 <li>mdsc - nominal uses mdsc which is available at 
  <a href="https://github.com/sjbutler/mdsc/">https://github.com/sjbutler/mdsc/</a></li>
 <li>idtk - nominal uses classes from idtk which is available at 
  <a href="https://github.com/sjbutler/idtk-j/">https://github.com/sjbutler/idtk-j/</a></li>
 <li>ANTLR - ANTLR 4 is required to run nominal and to compile any
   changes to the grammar. antlr-x.x-complete.jar must be on 
   the classpath. nominal was coded against ANTLR v4.4
   See <a href="http://www.antlr.org/">http://www.antlr.org/</a>
   (ANTLRWorks 2 is a useful tool for working with ANTLR grammars)</li>
 </ol>
 
 <h3>Caveat</h3>
 <p>nominal is research software. As such it is subject to change and 
 no guarantees can be made about the stability of any API. There is 
 also no guarantee that nominal will be maintained. </p>
