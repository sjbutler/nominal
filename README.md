naming conventions.

identifier naming conventions that can be used to specify 
conventions to test against. A description of the language
can be found in the docs directory.

Requirements
============
nominal requires Java v8 to run. It is possible to revise nominal to run 
using Java 7, but a lot of work would be entailed.

Dependencies
============
nominal has two dependencies:
(1) SLF4J - nominal used SLF4J for logging. Incorporating SLF4J in your 
    (exisitng) code is straightforward. See http://slf4j.org/ for more
    information
(2) mdsc - nominal uses mdsc which is available at 
    https://github.com/sjbutler/mdsc/
